The gameplay copies the mechanics of the original game, but in offline mode: the main character follows the mouse; the further the mouse is, the faster the speed of the hero; facing smaller opponents or food, the hero absorbs them;
when faced with larger opponents or food, they absorb it; The larger the hero's size, the lower his speed.
